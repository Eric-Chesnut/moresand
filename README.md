# Moresand
Guess what? More sand!

This is a scalable version of my falling sand simulator. It supports variable chunk sizes, uses dirty rects to minimize the number of calculations performed on each chunk, automatically adds new chunks as particles enter their space, automatically deletes empty chunks to increase efficiency, and supports multithreading to also increase efficiency.
